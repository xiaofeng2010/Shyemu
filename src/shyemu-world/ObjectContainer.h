/*	Under Development
 *
 *	This class acts as a single object, but actually consists of multiple
 *  sub-objects that all orient around the location of the container 
 *  objects (x, y) position. z is constant. A change in parent object
 *  orientation needs to rotate each object.
 *
 *  One application of this would be for vehicles. Another would be for
 *  NPC's on transports.
