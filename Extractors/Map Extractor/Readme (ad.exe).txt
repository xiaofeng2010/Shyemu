---This will extract the maps required to run ShyEMU---
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1) Place ad.exe into your World of Warcraft directory.

Windows 7/Windows Vista: C:\Users\Public\Games\World of Warcraft

Windows xp: C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft


Step 2) Run ad.exe and let it run (it should take about 30 mins - 1 hour)

Step 3) Once it is done you will see a folder called "maps"

Copy it to your ShyEMU server directory


--You now have the latest maps for your server--

NOTE: You will only need to do this every time a new patch is released.
